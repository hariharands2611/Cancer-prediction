Breast-Cancer-prediction-using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
# Project overview
Given the details of cell nuclei taken from breast mass, predict whether or not a patient has breast cancer using the Ensembling Techniques. Perform necessary exploratory data analysis before building the model and evaluate the model based on performance metrics other than model accuracy.
# Project approech
